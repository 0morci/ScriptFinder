# ScriptFinder
ScriptFinder is an intelligent chatbot application designed to enhance the movie-watching experience by providing instant access to film scripts and detailed information about movie content. Users simply input the name of a film, and the chatbot fetches the corresponding script from online sources. The app offers two core features: the ability to download the movie script as a PDF or ask questions about the movie, enabling the chatbot to search the script for specific scenes, dialogues, or details. Ideal for film enthusiasts, writers, or researchers, ScriptFinder AI combines convenience with powerful natural language processing to deliver accurate, real-time movie insights.
